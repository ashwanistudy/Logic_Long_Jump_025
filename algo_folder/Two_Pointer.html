                        <h2>overview</h2>
                        <p id="p1">The Two Pointer technique is a fundamental concept in computer science used for
                            solving problems that involve searching or processing elements in an array or list. This
                            technique utilizes two pointers that
                            traverse the data structure from different ends or positions to efficiently solve a variety
                            of problems.
                            It is particularly useful for problems involving sorted arrays and for optimizing the time
                            complexity of
                            algorithms.</p>

                        <h2>What is Two Pointer Technique?</h2>
                        <p id="p1">The Two Pointer technique is an algorithmic strategy where two pointers are used to
                            iterate through an
                            array or list from different starting points, typically from the beginning and the end. This
                            method is
                            effective for solving problems such as finding pairs that meet certain criteria, merging
                            sorted arrays,
                            and more.</p>

                        <h2>Basic Operations of Two Pointer Technique?</h2>
                        <h3>Initialize Pointers:<p>Set two pointers at the desired starting positions, usually at the
                                beginning and
                                end of the array.</p>
                        </h3>
                        <h3>Move Pointers:<p> Adjust the pointers based on the problem's requirements, such as moving
                                one pointer
                                forward and the
                                other backward.</p>
                        </h3>
                        <h3>Check Condition:<p>Evaluate the condition or criteria for the current elements pointed to by
                                the two
                                pointers.</p>
                        </h3>
                        <h3>Update Pointers:<p> Modify the positions of the pointers based on the result of the
                                condition check.</p>
                        </h3>

                        <h3>Efficiency:<p>Reduces the time complexity of problems by eliminating the need for nested
                                loops.</p>
                        </h3>

                        <h3>Palindrome Checking:<p>Determining if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from
                                both ends.
                            </p>

                                paradigm.</p>
                        </h3>

                        <h3>Sorted Data Requirement:<p>Often requires the data to be sorted, which may involve
                                additional

                        </h3>

                        <h3>Same Direction Pointers:<p>Pointers move in the same direction but at different speeds or
                                steps.</p>
