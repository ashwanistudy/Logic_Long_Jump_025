Binary Search is known for its efficiency and speed, making it a widely used algorithm in various applications.",
            "What is Binary Search?": "Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target element is less than the middle element of the interval, the interval is narrowed to the lower half. Otherwise, it is narrowed to the upper half. The process continues until the target element is found or the interval is empty.",
            "Steps of Binary Search Algorithm": "Step 1: Start with the middle element of the sorted array.\nStep 2: If the middle element is the target value, return its index.\nStep 3: If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half.\nStep 4: If the target value is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half.\nStep 5: Continue until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.",

            "Advantages of Using Binary Search": "High Efficiency: Much faster than linear search for large datasets due to its O(log n) time complexity.\nSimplicity: Relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement.\nPredictable Performance: Provides consistent and predictable performance regardless of the dataset size.",
            "Disadvantages of Using Binary Search": "Requires Sorted Data: The array must be sorted prior to performing the binary search.\nStatic Data: Inefficient for datasets that change frequently due to the need for re-sorting.\nIndex-Based: Only applicable to data structures that allow random access, such as arrays.",

            "Why is the Time Complexity of Binary Search O(log n)?": "Explanation: Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In each step, the size of the interval is halved, leading to a logarithmic reduction in the number of elements to be checked. Therefore, the time complexity is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The base of the logarithm is 2, but in Big-O notation, the base is not specified because it only affects the constant factor, not the overall complexity."

            "overview": "The Two Pointer technique is a fundamental concept in computer science used for solving problems that involve searching or processing elements in an array or list. This technique utilizes two pointers that traverse the data structure from different ends or positions to efficiently solve a variety of problems. It is particularly useful for problems involving sorted arrays and for optimizing the time complexity of algorithms. <img style='width:100%' class='img-fluid mt-2' src='./assest/image/two_pointer.png'>",
            "What is Two Pointer Technique?": "The Two Pointer technique is an algorithmic strategy where two pointers are used to iterate through an array or list from different starting points, typically from the beginning and the end. This method is effective for solving problems such as finding pairs that meet certain criteria, merging sorted arrays, and more.",
            "Basic Operations of Two Pointer Technique?": "<b>Initialize Pointers:</b> Set two pointers at the desired starting positions, usually at the beginning and end of the array.<br> <b>Move Pointers:</b> Adjust the pointers based on the problem's requirements, such as moving one pointer forward and the other backward.<br> <b>Check Condition:</b> Evaluate the condition or criteria for the current elements pointed to by the two pointers.<br> <b>Update Pointers:</b> Modify the positions of the pointers based on the result of the condition check.",
            "Properties of Two Pointer": "<b>Efficiency:</b> Reduces the time complexity of problems by eliminating the need for nested loops.<br> <b>Simplicity:</b> Easy to implement and understand for many common problems.<br> <b>Versatility:</b> Applicable to a wide range of problems involving sorted and unsorted arrays.",
